# DNS Spoofing and Detection System

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **DNS Spoofing Attack** and a **Detection Mechanism** using Python and Scapy.  
The aim is to show how attackers can manipulate DNS responses to redirect victims to malicious IPs, and how defenders can detect and prevent such activities.

> ⚠ **Educational Purpose Only**  
> This project is intended solely for cybersecurity research and education in a controlled lab environment.

## 🚀 Features
- **DNS Spoofing Module** → Redirects DNS queries for a target domain to a fake IP.
- **Detection Module** → Monitors network traffic for suspicious DNS responses.
- **Customizable** → Modify target domain and spoof IP easily.
- **Logging** → Saves detection logs for analysis.
- **Cross-Platform** → Works on Linux & Windows (with admin/root privileges).

## 🛠 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnshumanRajSingh/dns-spoofing-project.git
cd dns-spoofing-project
```

### 2️⃣ Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run with Root/Admin Privileges  
On **Linux/Kali**:
```bash
sudo python3 dns_spoof.py
```
On **Windows (PowerShell)**:
```powershell
python dns_spoof.py
```

---

## 📜 Usage

### **Run DNS Spoofing**
```bash
sudo python3 dns_spoof.py -t <target_domain> -i <fake_ip>
```
Example:
```bash
sudo python3 dns_spoof.py -t example.com -i 192.168.1.100
```

### **Run DNS Detection**
```bash
sudo python3 dns_detect.py
```
This will monitor traffic and alert if it detects spoofed DNS responses.
